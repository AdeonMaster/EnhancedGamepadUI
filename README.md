The Elder Scrolls Online addon which improves keyboard & mouse compatibility with the gamepad interface. Used to play on PC without any connected gamepad controllers

Are you a truth gamepad UI lover? Do you think that gamepad UI looks better and simpler that original PC interface? Then probably you would need to use this addon!
